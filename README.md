# Malaria Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build an efficient system for the automatic diagnosis of malaria by detecting the presence of the Plasmodium parasite in blood cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Given the significant health burden posed by malaria, particularly in Africa, accurate and timely diagnosis can greatly improve patient outcomes and reduce transmission rates.

## Problem Definition
Malaria is a critical health concern globally, with an estimated 249 million cases and 608,000 deaths reported in 2022. Diagnosing malaria manually through microscopic image examination is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and subject to human error. This project leverages CNNs due to their exemplary ability to extract features for accurate image classification.

### Objectives
- To develop an accurate CNN model for classifying blood cells as parasitized or uninfected.
- To create a model suitable for deployment in field clinics, offering rapid results.

### Key Questions
- What are the characteristics of the images?
- How can we differentiate between parasitized and uninfected cells?
- What preprocessing methods enhance the image inputs for CNNs?
- How do existing pre-trained models perform compared to our custom-trained models?
- What is the most effective and efficient CNN architecture for this task?

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 24,958 training images and 2,600 test images of colored blood samples, divided into:
- **Parasitized**: Cells that contain the Plasmodium parasite.
- **Uninfected**: Cells free from the parasite.

## Getting Started
To experiment with this project, you can open it in Google Colab. Follow these steps to set up:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malaria-detection.git
    cd malaria-detection
    ```

2. Install necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    !pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Load the dataset into your Google Drive, extract it, and run the preprocessing scripts provided in the notebook.

## Web Application

This project includes a Flask web application for user-friendly prediction of malaria in blood cell images.
